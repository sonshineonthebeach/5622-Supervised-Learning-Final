CSCA 5622 Supervised Learning Final Project

Problem to Solve: Heart Attack Prediction
This project analyzes and applies various supervised learning methods on hear attack dataset which was downloaded from the internet to solve problems and answers questions or simply help us understand more about what conditions can lead to hear attacks. There are factors that affect heart attack chance more than others. Understanding and knowing more about and their relationships can help us prevent hear attack diseases.

Data Source
The data was downloaded from the internet.

Data includes: Patient ID,Age,Sex,Cholesterol,Blood Pressure,Heart Rate,Diabetes,Family History,Smoking,Obesity,Alcohol Consumption,Exercise Hours Per Week,Diet,Previous Heart Problems,Medication Use,Stress Level,Sedentary Hours Per Day,Income,BMI,Triglycerides,Physical Activity Days Per Week,Sleep Hours Per Day,Country,Continent,Hemisphere,Heart Attack Risk

Supervised Learning Methods Used
Logistic Regression: This method is used for showing us how true positive and false positive cases layouts in the datasets. It helps us understand more about binary classification tasks.

Decision Trees: Decision trees are useful for understanding how various features in the data influence the outcome (high or low risk of heart attack).

Random Forest: Random Forests are less likely to overfit than a single decision tree and provide importance scores for each feature, which can help in understanding which factors are most influential in predicting heart attack risk.

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): This method is used to show us what factors can increase chance of getting heart attacks. How the factors are weighed and their importances in this heart attack research.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): This method help us find the best boundary line that separates the data into two classes. It also shows supports and dataset that is relevant to the boundary.
